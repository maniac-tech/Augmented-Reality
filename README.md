# Augmented-Reality
### What is Augmented Reality?
Augmented Reality’s definition varies from one person to another, but the concept remains the same.
My definition of AR is to _put some extra information on the user’s real world_. This _some extra information_ varies from text to objects, and the real world remains unaffected from this superimposed information.

Google’s Definition: _"a technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, thus providing a composite view"_

### Getting Started
There are many SDKs available which will help you implement your ideas. Alongside, you’ll require some development platform to implement your ideas using these SDKs.

Talking about platforms, you can develop the application for Android, iOS, Windows, and many more. You may use Android Studio or Xcode for developing on Android or iOS respectively. You may also use _Unity_ or _Unreal game engine_ for developing applications for all the above mentioned platforms.
